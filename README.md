# EukRep
Classification of Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic sequences from metagenomic datasets
=======================
# Installation #
* Easy install with pip
```
$ pip install EukRep
```
----
# Usage #
* Identify sequences predicted to be of Eukaryotic origin
```
$ EukRep -i <Sequences in Fasta format> -o <Eukaryote sequence file>
```

To obtain high quality gene predictions for and bin identified eukaryotic contigs as described in "Genome-reconstruction for eukaryotes from complex natural microbial communities" (West et al. in review), see methods section or read below
