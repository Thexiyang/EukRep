# EukRep #
Classification of Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic sequences from metagenomic datasets
# Installation #
* Easy install with pip
```
$ pip install EukRep
```
# Usage #
* Identify and ouput sequences predicted to be of eukaryotic origin from a sequence fasta file:
```
$ EukRep -i <Sequences in Fasta format> -o <Output file>
```

To obtain high quality gene predictions for and bin identified eukaryotic contigs as described in "Genome-reconstruction for eukaryotes from complex natural microbial communities" (West et al. in review), see methods section or read below
